# A03 – User Registration API with React Frontend

This project delivers a full user registration workflow built with a **ExpressJS backend** and a **React frontend**.  
It includes secure user creation, form validation, API integration, and a clean UI for both registration and login pages.

The backend exposes a `/user/register` endpoint with proper validation, password hashing, and error handling.  
The frontend provides a responsive, accessible sign-up and login experience using modern React tooling such as **React Hook Form** and **React Query**.

This repository serves as a practical exercise in designing a small but complete authentication flow, covering API development, frontend integration, and essential UX considerations.
